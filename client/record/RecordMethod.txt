We can use pyaudio to record voice in Raspberry Pi.

1. Install pyaudio

Run following codes:

$ sudo apt-get install python-pyaudio
$ sudo apt-get install git
$ git clone http://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/git/pyaudio.git
$ sudo apt-get install libportaudio0 libportaudio2 libportaudiocpp0 portaudio19-dev
$ sudo apt-get python-dev

2. Then a new folder named "pyaudio" will be generated.

Run these codes:

$ cd pyaudio
$ sudo python setup.py instal

Pyaudio will be installed successfully if there is no mistake.

3. Run the record.py to record a voice.
